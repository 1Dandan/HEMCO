Configuring HEMCO
#################

Usage of HEMCO within GEOS-Chem is documented at the GEOS-Chem Wiki,
in `The HEMCO User's Guide
<http://wiki.geos-chem.org/The_HEMCO_User%27s_Guide>`_.

.. note::

   We are in the process of porting :program:`HEMCO` documentation
   from the GEOS-Chem wiki to this ReadTheDocs manual.  Please bear
   with us during this transition.

You may also find Figure 2 in :cite:`Lin_et_al._2021` useful to
understand the structure of the HEMCO configuration file,
:file:`HEMCO_Config.rc`:
