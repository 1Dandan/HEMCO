Computer system requirements
============================

Before you can run :program:`HEMCO`, you will need to have one the
following items.
 
#. A Unix or Linux based computer system, OR:
#. An account on the `Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform
   <http://geos-chem-cloud.readthedocs.io/>`_.   

If your institution has computational resources (e.g. a shared
computer cluster with many cores, sufficient disk storage and memory),
then you can run :program:`HEMCO` there.  Contact your IT staff for
assistance.

If your institution lacks computational resources (or if you need
additional computational resources beyond what is available), then you
should consider signing up for access to the Amazon Web Services
cloud. Using the cloud has the following advantages:    
                                  
#. You can run :program:`HEMCO` and/or :program:`GEOS-Chem` without
   having to invest in local hardware and maintenance personnel.
#. You won't have to download any meteorological fields or emissions
   data. All of the necessary data input for :program:`HEMCO` and/or
   :program:`GEOS-Chem` will be available on the cloud.                 
#. You can initialize your computational environment with all of the
   required software (e.g. compilers,libraries, utilities) that you
   need for :program:`HEMCO` and/or :program:`GEOS-Chem`.
#. Your runs will be 100% reproducible, because you will initialize
   your computational environment the same way every time.
#. You will avoid compilation errors due to library incompatibilities. 
#. You will be charged for the computational time that you use, and if
   you download dataoff the cloud.

Memory requirements
===================

If you plan to run :program:`HEMCO` on a local computer system, please make
sure that your system has sufficient memory and disk space.
